Case: Best Buy offers millions of products through BestBuy.ca, which provides customers with lots of options but also makes it difficult for customers to quickly compare specs with other similar products to pick the best one. The goal of this case is to provide some way for customers to easily compare product specs (e.g. app, web widget, browser plug-in, voice assistant, or other ideas).

This web application was created with React.js
- Given under 24 hours for the development of app, business plan, pitch, feasibility analysis, marketing plan, and implementation timeline
- Based on user preference, our web application maps key values associated with the choice and returns data pulled from Best Buy's API
- Collaborated in a team of 4 students
